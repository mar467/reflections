When you initialize a repository, you create an empty .git file which from that point on tracks all commits to the repo's history

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in that it is an intermediate state before a group of files is officially committed to the repo as a git commit. This is valuable because it allows you to pick and choose what files you want to commit at a given time.
